								<b><a href="https://ngts.planethunters.org">Planet Hunters NGTS</a></b><br> During my PhD, I am leading the data analysis of the Planet
								 Hunters NGTS citizen science project. Exoplanet detection using transit surveys relies on many hours of human vetting to search for
								  transit-like signals and filter out false positives. The power of citizen science has been proven by projects such as Galaxy Zoo,
								   Planet Hunters and Planet Hunters TESS. These platforms present images or light curves from telescopes and utilise classifications
								    from public volunteers to categorise astronomical phenomena, drastically increasing the speed at which researchers can discover
									 new objects such as transiting exoplanets. My research is focused on exoplanet detection and measuring the detection efficiencies
									  of citizen scientists using the <a href="https://ngts.planethunters.org">ngts.planethunters.org</a> Zooniverse project.
									   Planet Hunters NGTS is the next iteration of the Planet Hunters project, using data from the Next-Generation Transit Survey
									    to search for exoplanet candidates missed in the initial searches by the science team.

								<b>NGTS Scintillation Monitoring</b><br> For my MSc by Research, I investigated the noise properties of scintillation-dominated
								 light curves from the <a href="http://ngtransits.org/"> NGTS</a> telescopes at the Paranal Observatory in Chile. Atmospheric
								  scintillation is caused by light passing through turbulent regions of the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in changes in intensity of
								   the light received by a telescope. This is more colloquially known as the "twinkling" we see when observing stars with the naked
								    eye. This is the dominant noise source when observing bright stars with small-aperture ground-based telescopes, such as at the
									 NGTS observatory. I compared the photometric noise of NGTS light curves with theoretical noise models, such as the modified Young's
									  equation, and measured the empirical scintillation coefficient C<sub>Y</sub>. We found agreement between NGTS measurements of
									   C<sub>Y</sub> and previous independent measurements of the scintillation. We also found correlations with monthly high-altitude
									    wind speeds: long-exposure scintillation decreased as these wind speeds increased. This is because the turbulence cells are averaged
										 out during the long-exposure time of the NGTS telescopes. A gif of the monthly changes in wind speed above South America can be
										  viewed <a href="https://astro-sobrien.github.io/mscthesis_gif.html">here.</a> This gif is linked in my MSc thesis.
