							What if Wayne Gretzky never scored a goal? We all know the headline stat. 
							If Wayne Gretzky never scored a goal in his career, he’d still have more points 
							(goals plus assists) than any other player in NHL history. The Great One had 1,963 
							assists (and 894 goals) in his 21-year career while the next-highest points scorer is 
							Jaromír Jágr with 766 goals and 1,155 assists for a measly 1,921 points. But what 
							difference would a goalless Gretzky have on his season-to-season accolades and how 
							would it affect his teams’ chances of making the playoffs and winning the Stanley Cup?
